Obsurdle, the Hawt New Word Game, was designed in honor of New York Times' Wordle. The difference in our game is that the user is guessing a seven letter word and given seven attempts to do so. I created two files for the main program and the wordlist for organization purposes, and Dallin worked on the logic and graphics for word matches and the game startscreen respectively.
