This is the One Day Calculator project we started off the year with. The goal was to code a fully functioning text-based calculator all in one class period. The calculator uses 4 functions to complete two-number operations.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
